CHECK-1#1 Warning
Report disabled checks  
The following rules are disabled: ADEF-911, REQP-1741
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sys_top_i/nvme_ctrl_0/inst/user_top_inst0/s_axi_top_inst0/s_axi_reg_inst0/r_nvme_reg_rdata_reg[31]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sys_top_i/nvme_ctrl_0/inst/user_top_inst0/s_axi_top_inst0/s_axi_reg_inst0/sys_top_nvme_ct293_LUT6_244/O, cell sys_top_i/nvme_ctrl_0/inst/user_top_inst0/s_axi_top_inst0/s_axi_reg_inst0/sys_top_nvme_ct293_LUT6_244. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

REQP-1857#1 Advisory
RAMB18E2_writefirst_collision_advisory  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (sys_top_i/gpic_0/s00_couplers/s00_data_fifo/inst/gen_fifo.fifo_gen_inst/inst_fifo_gen/gaxi_full_lite.gread_ch.grdch2.axi_rdch/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.mem/gbm.gbmg.gbmga.ngecc.bmg/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_noinit.ram/DEVICE_8SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SDP.WIDE_PRIM18.ram) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. It is strongly suggested to change this mode to NO_CHANGE for best power characteristics. However, both WRITE_FIRST and NO_CHANGE may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design.

REQP-1858#13 Advisory
RAMB36E2_writefirst_collision_advisory  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (sys_top_i/nvme_ctrl_0/inst/pcie4_uscale_plus_0_i/inst/pcie_4_0_pipe_inst/pcie_4_0_bram_inst/RAM32K.bram_comp_inst/bram_16k_1_int/ECC_RAM.RAMB36E2[2].ramb36e2_inst) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. It is strongly suggested to change this mode to NO_CHANGE for best power characteristics. However, both WRITE_FIRST and NO_CHANGE may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
